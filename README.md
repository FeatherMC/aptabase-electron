# Electron SDK for Aptabase

Instrument your Electron apps with Aptabase, an Open Source, Privacy-First and Simple Analytics for Mobile, Desktop and Web Apps.

## Install

Install the SDK using your preferred JavaScript package manager

```bash
pnpm add @aptabase/electron
# or
npm add @aptabase/electron
# or
yarn add @aptabase/electron
```

## Usage with `nodeIntegration: false` and `contextIsolation: true` (recommended)

If you have node integration disabled and context isolation enabled, you need to use the subpackages of this SDK.

First you need to get your `App Key` from Aptabase, you can find it in the `Instructions` menu on the left side menu.

On your Electron main's process, initialize the SDK after the app is ready:

```js
import { initialize } from "@aptabase/electron/main";

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  initialize("<YOUR_APP_KEY>"); // ðŸ‘ˆ this is where you enter your App Key

  // ... the rest of your app initialization code
});
```

When tracking events from your `main` process, import the `trackEvent` from the `@aptabase/electron/main` package and call it:

```js
import { trackEvent } from "@aptabase/electron/main";

trackEvent("connect_click"); // An event with no properties
trackEvent("play_music", { name: "Here comes the sun" }); // An event with a custom property
```

To track events from the renderer process, add this to your preload script:

```js
import { exposeAptabase } from "@aptabase/electron/preload";

exposeAptabase();
```

Afterwards you can use the `trackEvent` function, but this time from the `@aptabase/electron/renderer` package:

```js
import { trackEvent } from "@aptabase/electron/renderer";

trackEvent("connect_click"); // An event with no properties
trackEvent("play_music", { name: "Here comes the sun" }); // An event with a custom property
```

## Usage with `nodeIntegration: true` and `contextIsolation: false`

This is not recommended for security reasons, but if you already have node integration enabled, you can use the `@aptabase/electron` package directly.

First you need to get your `App Key` from Aptabase, you can find it in the `Instructions` menu on the left side menu.

On your Electron main's process, initialize the SDK after the app is ready:

```js
import { initialize } from "@aptabase/electron";

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  initialize("<YOUR_APP_KEY>"); // ðŸ‘ˆ this is where you enter your App Key

  // ... the rest of your app initialization code
});
```

To track events, import the `trackEvent` function from the `@aptabase/electron` package and call it from either the main process or the renderer process:

```js
import { trackEvent } from "@aptabase/electron";

trackEvent("connect_click"); // An event with no properties
trackEvent("play_music", { name: "Here comes the sun" }); // An event with a custom property
```

## Notes

A few important notes:

1. The SDK will automatically enhance the event with some useful information, like the OS, the app version, and other things.
2. You're in control of what gets sent to Aptabase. This SDK does not automatically track any events, you need to call `trackEvent` manually.
   - Because of this, it's generally recommended to at least track an event at startup
3. You do not need to await the `trackEvent` function, it'll run in the background.
4. Only strings and numbers values are allowed on custom properties
